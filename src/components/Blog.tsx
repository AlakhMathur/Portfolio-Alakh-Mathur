      title: "Building Scalable React Applications: Lessons from PreAssess",
      excerpt: "Key insights and best practices I learned while developing PreAssess, a dependency-aware assessment platform using React and TypeScript.",
      content: `Building PreAssess was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my development journey. As a Computer Science student at NIT Patna with a 9.56 CGPA, I've always been passionate about creating solutions that make a real impact in education.

## The Challenge

The core problem we wanted to solve was the traditional linear learning approach where students often struggle with advanced topics because they haven't mastered the prerequisites. PreAssess addresses this by implementing a dependency-aware learning system that unlocks topics only after prerequisites are cleared.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
We chose React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. The application follows a component-based architecture with:

- **Custom Hooks**: For state management and API calls
- **Context API**: For global state management (user authentication, course progress)
- **React Router**: For navigation and route protection
- **Styled Components**: For consistent theming

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **State Management**: Instead of Redux, we used React Context API with useReducer for complex state logic. This kept our bundle size smaller and made the code more maintainable.

2. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implemented React.memo for expensive components
   - Used useMemo for complex calculations
   - Lazy loading for route-based code splitting

3. **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript implementation helped catch bugs early and improved code documentation.

## The Dependency System

The heart of PreAssess is its dependency management system. We implemented a graph-based approach where each topic has dependencies that must be completed before unlocking new content.

This allowed us to create dynamic learning paths that adapt to each student's progress.

## AI Integration with Llama3

One of the most exciting features was integrating Llama3 for intelligent question generation. We created a system that:

- Analyzes topic content to generate relevant questions
- Adapts question difficulty based on student performance
- Provides personalized learning recommendations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Planning is Crucial**: Spending time on architecture design saved us countless hours during development.

2. **User Testing**: Early user feedback helped us identify UX issues we hadn't considered.

3. **Performance Matters**: Even with modern frameworks, performance optimization is crucial for user experience.

4. **Documentation**: Good documentation is as important as good code.

## Results

PreAssess has been successfully deployed and is being used by students. The platform has shown significant improvements in learning outcomes, with students reporting better understanding of complex topics.
